## 1. Delagates

- An object that knows hot to call a method (or a group of methods).
- A reference to a function.
- Why we need Delegates?
  - For designing extensible and flexible application (e.g. frameworks).
- Alternative: Interfaces.
- Interfaces or Delegates? Use a delegate when:
  - An eventing design pattern is used.
  - The caller doesn't need to access other properties or methods on the object implementing the method.

## 2. Events and Delegates

- A mechanism for communication between objects.
- Used in building _Loosely Coupled Application_.
- Helps extending application.
